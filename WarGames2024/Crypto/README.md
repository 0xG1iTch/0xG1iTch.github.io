### Challenge Files
- [Leak_stuff.rar](./Leak_stuff.rar)

## Solution

This challenge was straightforward, and here's how I solved it step-by-step:

1. **Decompressing the Archive:**
   First, I extracted the contents of the [Leak_stuff.rar](./Leak_stuff.rar) file. Inside the archive, I found two files: `user.txt` and `password.txt`.

2. **Identifying the User:**
   The challenge prompt asked to search for the user "osman" in the `user.txt` file. I quickly found the user at line 337.

3. **Finding the Encrypted Password:**
   I looked for the corresponding line in the `password.txt` file. The entry related to "osman" turned out to be: `ZJPB{e6g180g9f302g8d8gddg1i2174d0e212}`

4. **Decrypting the Password:**
   The string looked like a Caesar cipher with a shift. I tried various Caesar cipher shifts using the online tool [Cryptii](https://cryptii.com/). The shift of **23** decrypted the string correctly.
