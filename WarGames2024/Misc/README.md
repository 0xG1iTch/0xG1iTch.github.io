## Solution

This challenge involved extracting the Flag from  a GIF file. Hereâ€™s how I solved it:
   I opened the [gif.gif](./gift.gif.zip) file using a normal image preview software, that allowed me to view the individual frames of the GIF as static images (ause i opened it as an image).
   The GIF had **1402 frames** in total. I scrolled through all the frames and found the flag in the **last frame**.

3. **Alternative Approach (Using Online Tools):**
   You can use online tools like [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/split) to split the GIF into all its frames, if you can't run the gif as image. From there, you can easily locate and copy the flag from the final frame.
